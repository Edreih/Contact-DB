## Contact-DB

During my IS Application Development (CIS 2348) class with Professor Natalia Fofanova at the University of Houston, I created a Java application that manages contact information. This application is capable of:

* Showing a list of contacts
* Creating, viewing, editing, and deleting a contact
* Storing contacts in a database
* Generating a tableview of contacts in a database
* Exporting contacts to a Microsoft Excel xlsx workbook file
* Importing CSV file with contact information to database
* Data validation (alert boxes are displayed as a warning)
